**Blender site for IMD-1005-A**

**Brief Description**
This website is a redesign for the software, Blender. I wanted to introduce a more simple and stylistic approach to the interface of the website. 
The main purpose is to both simplify navigation as well as provide the user with a more visually appealing experience.

**Changes from Assignment 1**
The most major change of the website when compared to the design from assignment 1 is the background for the pages.
I couldn't get the background gradient to behave exactly how I wanted like with the Figma design so its been slighty altered as a compromise.
Some small colour changes were made like the download button on the index page now using a gradient as opposed to a flat colour for more appealing visual design.

**AI Usage Documentation**
AI was used in one particular section of my stylesheet: 
line 296 uses "grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);" as suggested by AI so that each section of the 1 by 3 grid is equal in width by allowing each row to use a single fraction of 3.
